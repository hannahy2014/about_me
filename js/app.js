I worked closely with the UX specialist working on prototyping a new, more user-focused, patient record system. We used paper prototyping, Balsamiq and Wordpress. I also had the opportunity to work with the lead developer who was working on a Node.js web application and API, running on the IBM Bluemix cloud platform. My role was to convert an existing Bootstrap and jQuery front-end to a Bootstrap and Angular.js front-end."
